# Less Money In Politics


# "The Umbrella Promise"
"Less Money &amp; Less Party Politics in Washington"

Proposed By: iam4iam



A White Paper on How To End Big Money in DC

Weaken the Lobbyists & Special Interest Groups

Limit the Power of Party Elites & Partisan Politics

Dramatically Shrink Money in Elections


# PROBLEM SUMMARY:

We all know there is too much money in Politics.
We also know that Lobbyists and Special Interest Money Corrupts our Representative.
Their Money Funds the Political Party Machines.
Too Much Money is Spent Influencing Campaigns and Elections.
This Money Circumvents the Voice of "We The People"


# SOLUTION:

# "The Umbrella Promise"

Is a plan to make Washington Representative represent us, We The People.
They will no longer represent special interest or vote only by Party Lines.

We can take back control of Legislative Agendas in Washington.
The "Umbrella Promise" is in accordance with the US Constitution.

# The Solution = A Public Legislation DAO in Each Congressional District.

A New Constitutionally Sound Way of Representation
The Legislative DAO is Blockchain Based
This App is On Your Phone and Can Be Accessed on Your Computer or Devices
Citizens in a Congressional District Can Vote on Legislation in a DAO & The Representative Must Vote in Congress per Results of the DAO Vote
The Representative Then Votes and Represents the DAO and NOT Party Leaders, Special Interest Groups, or How Lobbyists Want Them To Vote
Using a Blockchain DAO Means Everyone's Vote is Counted, is Transparent, Secure and Immunitable
Only Citizens that Are Eligible Voters in that District Can Vote in the DAO
A Legislative DAO is Constitutional, It Is Freedom of Assembly
The Legislative DAO is Similar to a Homeowners Association, but Virtual
This DAO is like a District Wide Survey that is Continuous
DAO is Also Campaign Reform (Costly Campaigns Will Be A Thing of the Past)
Party Politics Ends, Representatives Vote per the DAO Not the Party
Lobbying Dollars Then Need to go to the Districts to Influence Us Because the Representative Votes per the DAO and Not per the Lobbyist
Issues Can Be Ranked in the DAO, Prioritizing the Work of the Representative
If a Representative Does Not Vote per the DAO, Immediate Impeachment Process Can Begin
Campaign Funds Can be Controlled by the DAO
Special Reason for the Name “Umbrella Promise”  The Representative Pledges & Promises with Their Sacred Honor to Vote for Legislation as Per The Legislative DAO in their District, Never per Party Leadership or per Lobbyists or per Special Interests.
Representative Are Also Protected by the Umbrella - They Don't Need to Raise Money for the Next Campaign - They Just Must Vote Per the DAO - Per the Will of Their Constituents


# Great News! Blockchain DAO Technology Exists Today
This Can Be Done
A Grassroots Campaign Can Take Back Washington
First Legislative DAO Candidate Will Cause a Giant Ripple in the DC Swamp
The People Will Restore Their Voice in Washington
